<p>Combination of computer hardware and software where software is embedded into hardware is called an embedded system. It is an electronic system that can be programmed based on our needs. There are a set of protocols where we can organize the way of working and controlling the system. The hardware where the software is embedded is built with the help of a microcontroller. The hardware is comprised of user interface which includes the display, input, and/or output interfaces and memory of the system. When we consider types of Embedded Systems, power supply, processor, and communication ports are needed for the system to function properly.</p>
